Hi Everyone!

So I know what youâ€™re thinking. Youâ€™ve never been to the gym before. You donâ€™t know how to work out. Thatâ€™s okay. I only started in my first year at Carleton too! In this short article, Iâ€™ll run you through everything you need to know to get started on hitting the gym!!!

### Where Do I Go? ðŸ¤”

First, the Carleton Athletics Centre has a fitness centre thatâ€™s free to use for students. You donâ€™t have to worry about paying them bills. Just swipe your card, and youâ€™re in. Itâ€™s open 6am to 11pm on weekdays and 8am to 8pm on weekends. One small caveat for you if youâ€™re a guy is that itâ€™s reserved between 10am-11:30am for womenâ€™s only hours.

So what now? The fitness centre doesnâ€™t like us bringing bags in. Thatâ€™s a problem but thereâ€™s a solution. Youâ€™ll soon find the menâ€™s change room if youâ€™re a guy and womenâ€™s change room on the second floor if youâ€™re a girl. You can put your bags in there. I wonâ€™t lie. I lock my locker but most people donâ€™t even lock their locker so feel free to forget about the lock! 

You only need a couple of things. Just have your phone and earbuds to listen to music. Make sure you have your water bottle to stay hydrated and if itâ€™s empty, they have a water fountain and bottle filler inside! Last, bring your campus card. Youâ€™ll need to swipe it to get inside the fitness centre room. After that, we head to the fitness centre on the second floor~

### Doâ€™s and Donâ€™ts in the Fitness CentreðŸ“š

Just like a classroom, the gym has some common sense rules that you wouldnâ€™t think about if ya didnâ€™t know. Iâ€™ll run it down for you!
- DO ask for advice on your form if you donâ€™t know if youâ€™re doing it right
- DO ask how to use equipment if youâ€™re hesitant
- Donâ€™t grunt loudly
- Donâ€™t work out too hard if you have no buddy
- Donâ€™t bring a bag inside
- Clean what you use after youâ€™re done
- Check that weights are placed correctly
- Donâ€™t drop weights. Putâ€™em down slowly


### How to work out ðŸ“š
So thereâ€™s a regimen to follow. First, you do 4 sets of 10. Basically, what this means is after doing 10 repetitions of an exercise, take an at-minimum 1 minute break. Then do your next set. 4 sets of 10 is pretty standard.

Adjusting the weight is also a major part. You know the weight is just right when itâ€™s not too easy but not too hard that youâ€™ll collapse. The sweet spot is that when youâ€™re on the 10th repetition, youâ€™re getting tired. The weights I put in are beginner friendly and if theyâ€™re still too heavy, donâ€™t even worry. Remove them and start somewhere comfortable. No one is going to shame you for trying your best!

Now for the juicy part. What exercises do ya do? If youâ€™re going to the gym twice per week, do a lower body and upper body day with chest exercises in each one. If youâ€™re going once, take your time to do a full body workout.

These are the lower body exercises that I follow

### Stretching ðŸ§˜

Iâ€™m not gonna lie. You might not notice but thereâ€™s a huge difference between stretching vs not-stretching in the long run. Iâ€™ll skip the part about possibly pulling a muscle if you donâ€™t stretch. Youâ€™ll feel less sore in 2 days because jeez, youâ€™re gonna feel sore in 2 days. And thatâ€™s not a bad thing. Iâ€™m still sore and Iâ€™ve been going to the gym for a month.

Thereâ€™s no specific stretches but just remember to stretch the following:
- Arms
- Biceps
- Belly/Abs area(upward dog stretch)
- Thighs(touch your toes while standing up or sit down and try to reach them)
- Butterfly!
- Calves

Closing Thoughts ðŸ’¬
This workout isnâ€™t to get jacked. This is just to stay healthy. No one gets abs in a day. And I mean it when I say everyone at the gym is a sweetheart. Ask and you shall receive. Just donâ€™t be a prick. 

The last part is probably the hardest for people to understand but it takes commitment. You canâ€™t just skip days when other stuff comes up. This is a priority.
