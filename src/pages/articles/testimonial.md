Hello Peeps,

So I‚Äôm writing this article to basically dispel some thoughts on what COMP1405Z is like. Basically, a lot of people think the Z section is just for the best of the best elites or we do advanced stuff. I‚Äôm saying nah, that‚Äôs not true at all üòÖ

### My CS Level to give you context üéöÔ∏è

To give you some context, my name‚Äôs John and I took the Z section in fall term of 2022. In high school, I took the grade 10,11, and 12 computer science courses. In grade 11, we went over variables, if statements, loops, input and output from a text file, and functions/methods. We pretty much made basic games like pong and breakout. In grade 12, we went over object oriented programming with concepts like inheritance, abstraction, subclasses, and polymorphism. We made a simple board game. Imagine checkers but a bit more complicated. All of this was in Java. So this is what I came into university with. Pretty average.

An important part here is the suffering. What I mean by that is, some of my friends are suffering in the normal 1405 section. I‚Äôm not able to solve this because I‚Äôm smart or whatever. There are lots of people smarter than me. I can solve the problem since I also suffered through those same troubles but just a bit earlier. That‚Äôs all.

### Standard Info

So COMP1405/1406Z works like this. You do 1405 in the first half of the fall term and 1406 in the second half of the fall term. This means it‚Äôs worth 1.0 credits. Most people take 1405 in the fall term and 1406 in the winter term. So the Z section is pretty much just speedrunning first year CS. We aren‚Äôt learning more advanced concepts. We‚Äôre just going faster.

Dave McKenney, who is one of the most chillest professors you‚Äôll ever meet, teaches the course. You can also work with a partner on all your assignments. Just find a good partner please. Someone you can trust to do their share of the work. I found the course pretty easy and below is an in-depth look at why I think so.

### Tutorials, Assignments, and Homework

So here‚Äôs how it works. Tutorial assignments are posted at the start of the week and due at the end of the week. I can legit do the assignment myself. It‚Äôs usually 3 simple problems. I can but don‚Äôt have to go to the tutorial days that are on Monday or Wednesday. I could probably get 100% on all my tutorial assignments without even going to a single tutorial. Not gonna lie, I went just to socialize with peeps. I‚Äôd be laughing if you asked me if I got work done there. We already had it done before we got there.

Dave also gives us homework and readings to do, but no cap. I didn‚Äôt read a single word of the python book and didn‚Äôt do any of the homework. So just to repeat, I legit went through COMP1405 without doing anything other than handing in the assignments and mandatory stuff. Homework and reading isn‚Äôt mandatory. If you know what a variable is, I‚Äôm not gonna read about what a variable is.
You guys don‚Äôt have anything to compare what I‚Äôm saying to. I can tell you what my friends in the A,B,C, and D sections had. They had mandatory tutorial days where problems are presented at the start of a tutorial session and are due at the end of the tutorial session. These tutorial sessions usually last an hour and a half. Additionally, they had assignments every week that contained around 10 questions. Some of their assignments, not the final project, required you to do research. In comparison, Dave gave us everything we needed.

### Lectures

So Dave posts the content lecture lessons online in the form of videos. He talks over his slides and does demos of coding in them. I‚Äôve got the attention span of a man on pure adrenaline so I ain‚Äôt wasting my time watching 1-2 hours per video. I play the videos at 2X speed. We‚Äôre speedrunning speedrunning now.

If you really wanna get technical, going in for lectures aren‚Äôt necessary either but it does help to go. On Tuesday, Adi, who is our Teaching Assistant, helps us make personal projects. Can you imagine? Screw needing to think about what projects you want to do. You‚Äôve got a fourth year, who knows what‚Äôs a good project, helping you make a project. It wasn‚Äôt even a lecture anymore. It was just awesome.

On Thursdays, Dave pretty much recaps what we learned in the video slide lessons. Then we go through a couple problems to apply that knowledge. In other words, Dave makes it a recap day. I go to classes and just do my other class‚Äôs homeworks.

### Pretty Much Free Marks for Workshops

So on top of easy assignments, you‚Äôve got workshops that you can but don‚Äôt have to do. Basically, you can do a workshop to boost your grade up by 1% in that class. You can get a total of 10% extra by doing 10 workshops. So if I had a 70 and I wanted an 80, bam! I just add 10%.

### Final Project

I wouldn‚Äôt say the final project was hard. It‚Äôs just time consuming. We made a web scraper and search engine. We‚Äôre given a link and we need to document the number of times words appear and the links they lead to. So we have a web scraper that scrapes the websites for all their info. The second part is a search engine that processes all the info we have and gives you search results based on what you searched. This might sound big brain but again, no. Dave provides multiple extra lectures on how to do this as well as. Multiple equations and decomposition. I highly recommend working with someone else.

### Midterm and Exams

So here‚Äôs how the midterm went. I can‚Äôt say the contents of the exam for the sake of academic integrity but here‚Äôs how it works. On the day of the midterm, I had 3 hours to complete 3 questions. But each question was worth more than the last one and a bit harder too. If you screw up on the midterm, worry not. If you do bad on the midterm, then you can bank on the exam to save you.

If your exam grade is higher than your midterm grade, then your midterm grade becomes your exam grade. So if I get 50% on the midterm and 90% on the exam, then my midterm grade becomes90% since the exam grade was higher than the midterm grade.

On the exam, we had 3 sections with 3 questions each. We were supposed to do 2 out of 3 questions in each section. If you do 3 questions in a section, they take the highest 2 out of 3. I was sort of a dummy so I was only able to do 2 out of 3 questions in each section.

I have mixed feelings about the midterm and exams. In the midterm, I wasn‚Äôt able to figure out how to fix a logic error that made my code return the wrong answer. My TA was an angel regardless and gave me a 91%. I should‚Äôve gotten a 60% on the midterm, man.

Then on the exam, the questions are decent but I was running into the dumbest mistakes like writing syntax wrong. I was like, ‚ÄúWhy the hell isn‚Äôt this working??? I‚Äôve been on this for 15 minutes! Oh, I forgot to add a comma. Bruh‚Äù. I got a 98% on that and like I said, I only did 2 out of 3 questions. My friends were actually smart and did all 9 questions. They only scored 1% better than me.

### Course Content

I would say this is the most important section. I‚Äôll give a brief overview of what we learned in that section.

#### How to Think Like a Programmer

This lecture is about how to think like a programmer. These are the 4 pillars
Understand abstraction, which is the concept that you don‚Äôt need to understand the underlying stuff that goes on to use it. For instance, I don‚Äôt need to know about how a car engine works to drive a car.
Decomposition. We break stuff down. You can simplify things by breaking them down into their own separate sections. Sort of like a list of steps.
Pattern recognition. A lot of stuff in programming has similar patterns. A lot of problems require loops. A lot of problems are similar so they have similar solutions. For instance, I might be in Toronto so I can‚Äôt take out the trash so my solution is texting my roommate to do it. Another problem could be that I‚Äôm in Montreal and can‚Äôt do the laundry to I call my canmate.
Algorithm Development. Algorithm is an overloaded word that really just means a step by step solution to a problem that a computer can do. You need to develop your problem solving skills and translate that to code.

#### Intro to Python

Identify the different types of values like int and boolean and float and use these variables in your program
Create simple drawings using SimpleGraphics but we never use SimpleGraphics, which I appreciate.
Perform basic Python calculations/input/output, which means using +,-,\*, /,%, and some other stuff
Understand how variables are stored in memory. I still don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs stored but okay
Identify three types of programming errors. One of them is syntax error. Just programming language rules. Another is something like logic error where it the code runs but produces the wrong result because you as the programmer screwed up your math somewhere.

#### Control Structures and Branching Lecture Slides

Define a Boolean value which means true or false
Design an Algorithm with Branching Structures. Basically, if, else if, and else statements
Define Nested Control Structures basically means an if statement inside an if statement or loop inside a loop
Identify the Depth of a Block of Code. How many loops and if statements are we in
Encode a Complex Branch with a Flat Structure means to use else if
