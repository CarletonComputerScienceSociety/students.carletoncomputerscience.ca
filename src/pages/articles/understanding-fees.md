What is My Tuition Used for?
Hello Everyone,

In this article, I’ll talk about some of the services our Tuition is used for. That way, we’re not paying for something we won’t be using.

### Get $227 by Dipping out of CUSA’s Health Plan

Dropping out of the CUSA Health Plan is nearly unheard of because they don’t tell ya. I heard from my roommate, and I don’t know how the heck he found out about this. It encompasses health, dental, vision, and travel. If you aren’t under your parents’ health plan already, then it is useful to have; otherwise, you’re basically paying for something you already have. If you want the full explanation, you can check out the link here.

#### Opt Out Period 🗓️

Opt outs are valid for the whole policy year, from Sept. 1, 2022 – Aug. 31, 2023.
Opts outs for Fall Term students can only be completed online during the Fall Change-of-Coverage Period from Sept. 6 - Oct. 3, 2022.

#### How to Drop Out

In September, you’re gonna wanna fill out this page. It’ll give you access to a page. You can figure it out but the important part is proof of coverage. It sounds overly bureaucratic. Honestly, just send a pic of your family’s health plan card or your parents’ healthcare document and a part that says “family”. If you’re dropping out in person, head to CUSA and just be persistent. They’ll most likely be very understanding but always prepare for the worst.

### Meal Plans Madness 🍉

First, let me tell you how the cafeteria works. Each time you swipe your card, you can get into the cafeteria where it’s basically an all-you-can-eat buffet but you can’t take anything out when you leave except a snack.

Now, I’ll break down the actual difference between the different meal plans but they have some things in common.
Each one has a limited amount of swipes/meals you can have.
Each one has dining dollars, which can be used for restaurants on-campus to get a discount. Think of it as a debit card but for restaurants on-campus. All dining dollars expire by the end of the academic year.

#### The All-Access Meal Plan 🍴

This is the simplest meal plan. You don’t actually get unlimited meals at the cafeteria . You just get more than enough. If you eat at the cafeteria 4 meals every day in your first year, then you’ll still have some left over when the fall term starts. You get $100 dining dollars.

#### The All-Access Plus Meal Plan 🍖

The all-access-plus meal plan is the same thing as the all-access meal plan except you get $300 extra dining dollars.

#### Reduced Meal Plan 🍽️

Unless you get into a suite, this one isn’t available for you. You can only get 10 meals per week, and you only have a total of $300 dining dollars to spend in the year.

#### Closing Thoughts

This is very subjective and based on my preference but I would pick the all-access meal plan. It gives you more than enough meals to last you throughout the year. If you’re thinking of going to restaurants on-campus with your friends a lot, then pick the all-access plus meal plan.

### Don’t Even Bother With Paying For Printing at University 🖨️

Okay. So you’ve got a couple options for printing. DON’T buy a whole printer. DON’T pay to use those printers on campus. It’s not worth it. Here’s what you’re gonna want to do.

#### Carleton Computer Science Society and Science Society 😎

What you’re gonna want to do is go for the Carleton Computer Science Society or Science Society for unlimited free printing. The Carleton Computer Science Society is located at Herzburg Building in room 4135. The Science Society is located in Herzburg Building in room 3413. Here are the email addresses you’re gonna want to email since we can’t individually connect to the printer.
CCSS: Just Walk in and ask the one in the office :D
SciSoc: office@sciencesociety.ca

#### CUSA’s coloured printing 🏳️‍🌈

CUSA offers 100 free prints, and it ain’t that much when each assignment is like 5 pages. CUSA’s printing is good if you want it to be coloured, but only 25 of them can be coloured. Other than that, it’s meh. Oh right, and their email is: freeprinting@cusaonline.ca

#### Carleton Fitness Center 🏋️

There’s a fitness center that we pay for in our tuition. Don’t forget to stay fit and healthy. I wrote an article that you can go to here!
