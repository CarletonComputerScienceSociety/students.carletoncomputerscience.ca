### 🤔Understanding Carleton’s Co-Op Program🤔

Hello peoples,
I’ll be frank. Carleton’s co-op program is a good opportunity to get a job if you have no experience. If you have experience and the skills to get a job outside of co-op already, then try applying for jobs outside of co-op.

### 📃The Co-op Process📃

You need to make a resume in co-op that meets a specific set of archaic requirements. This resume is graded, but the format doesn’t actually fit employers. As such, I recommend that you actually make two resumes. One actual resume that you submit for applications and one resume that you hand to the co-op board.

#### 👍Advantages👍

In co-op, all the employers know what courses you’ve taken. They know how competent you are.If you’re applying outside of co-op, then they don’t know where you’re at. They have to test you and test you.

In contrast to other universities, Carleton actually lets you actually choose your employer. Obviously, the employer might reject you but if you want to work at Facebook, then you have the chance to apply there. In other universities, employers choose you.

There are exclusive jobs that you can only get because of a tax credit. Basically, the only way that companies will employ you if you have little experience is if they get a tax break. This way, it’s viable.

#### 👎Disadvantages👎

Although you can choose where you apply to, you can only reject 1 time before you have to accept. This is bad because let’s say you apply to 3 jobs. Job A is your number 1 choice. Job B is your number 2 choice. Job C is your number 3 choice. If job c accepts you and you reject, then you’ll have to hope Job A accepts you because if Job B accepts you, then you can’t reject again for Job A’s acceptance.

Co-op also costs a lot of money. Obviously, you’ll make a profit by working in the long run but paying $400 in admin fees and $400 in work term fees for co-op every year time you have co-op adds up.

The last disadvantage is that grades are paired with it. First off, you need to maintain a 8.0 CGPA(Grade of at least 70% in all classes) to qualify for co-op. You also have to submit with your grades so if you’re really skilled in programming but your grades are bad, you’re less likely to get accepted.
