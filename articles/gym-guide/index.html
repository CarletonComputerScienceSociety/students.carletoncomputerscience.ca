        <p>Hi Everyone!</p><p>So I know what youâ€™re thinking. Youâ€™ve never been to the gym before. You donâ€™t know how to work out. Thatâ€™s okay. I only started in my first year at Carleton too! In this short article, Iâ€™ll run you through everything you need to know to get started on hitting the gym!!!</p><h3 id="where-do-i-go-">Where Do I Go? ðŸ¤”</h3><p>First, the Carleton Athletics Centre has a fitness centre thatâ€™s free to use for students. You donâ€™t have to worry about paying them bills. Just swipe your card, and youâ€™re in. Itâ€™s open 6am to 11pm on weekdays and 8am to 8pm on weekends. One small caveat for you if youâ€™re a guy is that itâ€™s reserved between 10am-11:30am for womenâ€™s only hours.</p><p>So what now? The fitness centre doesnâ€™t like us bringing bags in. Thatâ€™s a problem but thereâ€™s a solution. Youâ€™ll soon find the menâ€™s change room if youâ€™re a guy and womenâ€™s change room on the second floor if youâ€™re a girl. You can put your bags in there. I wonâ€™t lie. I lock my locker but most people donâ€™t even lock their locker so feel free to forget about the lock!</p><p>You only need a couple of things. Just have your phone and earbuds to listen to music. Make sure you have your water bottle to stay hydrated and if itâ€™s empty, they have a water fountain and bottle filler inside! Last, bring your campus card. Youâ€™ll need to swipe it to get inside the fitness centre room. After that, we head to the fitness centre on the second floor~</p><h3 id="dos-and-donts-in-the-fitness-centre">Doâ€™s and Donâ€™ts in the Fitness CentreðŸ“š</h3><p>Just like a classroom, the gym has some common sense rules that you wouldnâ€™t think about if ya didnâ€™t know. Iâ€™ll run it down for you!</p><ul>
<li>DO ask for advice on your form if you donâ€™t know if youâ€™re doing it right</li>
<li>DO ask how to use equipment if youâ€™re hesitant</li>
<li>Donâ€™t grunt loudly</li>
<li>Donâ€™t work out too hard if you have no buddy</li>
<li>Donâ€™t bring a bag inside</li>
<li>Clean what you use after youâ€™re done</li>
<li>Check that weights are placed correctly</li>
<li>Donâ€™t drop weights. Putâ€™em down slowly</li>
</ul><h3 id="how-to-work-out-">How to work out ðŸ“š</h3><p>So thereâ€™s a regimen to follow. First, you do 4 sets of 10. Basically, what this means is after doing 10 repetitions of an exercise, take an at-minimum 1 minute break. Then do your next set. 4 sets of 10 is pretty standard.</p><p>Adjusting the weight is also a major part. You know the weight is just right when itâ€™s not too easy but not too hard that youâ€™ll collapse. The sweet spot is that when youâ€™re on the 10th repetition, youâ€™re getting tired. The weights I put in are beginner friendly and if theyâ€™re still too heavy, donâ€™t even worry. Remove them and start somewhere comfortable. No one is going to shame you for trying your best!</p><p>Now for the juicy part. What exercises do ya do? If youâ€™re going to the gym twice per week, do a lower body and upper body day with chest exercises in each one. If youâ€™re going once, take your time to do a full body workout.</p><p>These are the lower body exercises that I follow</p><table>

</table><h3 id="stretching-">Stretching ðŸ§˜</h3><p>Iâ€™m not gonna lie. You might not notice but thereâ€™s a huge difference between stretching vs not-stretching in the long run. Iâ€™ll skip the part about possibly pulling a muscle if you donâ€™t stretch. Youâ€™ll feel less sore in 2 days because jeez, youâ€™re gonna feel sore in 2 days. And thatâ€™s not a bad thing. Iâ€™m still sore and Iâ€™ve been going to the gym for a month.</p><p>Thereâ€™s no specific stretches but just remember to stretch the following:</p><ul>
<li>Arms</li>
<li>Biceps</li>
<li>Belly/Abs area(upward dog stretch)</li>
<li>Thighs(touch your toes while standing up or sit down and try to reach them)</li>
<li>Butterfly!</li>
<li>Calves</li>
</ul><p>Closing Thoughts ðŸ’¬
This workout isnâ€™t to get jacked. This is just to stay healthy. No one gets abs in a day. And I mean it when I say everyone at the gym is a sweetheart. Ask and you shall receive. Just donâ€™t be a prick.</p><p>The last part is probably the hardest for people to understand but it takes commitment. You canâ€™t just skip days when other stuff comes up. This is a priority.</p><p>Want to add something? Are we missing something you would recommend to other students?
